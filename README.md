There are about 12 million deaths worldwide per year due to heart disease, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). In fact, cardiovascular diseases account for half of the deaths in the US and other developing countries. Using the data to understand what are the major diagnosis that can play a paramount role in whether or not a patient might develop a heart disease in the next 10 years based on old and current diagnosis.

Objective:
Using the data to understand what are the major diagnosis that can play a paramount role in whether or not a patient might develop a heart disease in the next 10 years based on old and current diagnosis.

DataSource:
